# gravity-maze

This game is made with SDL v2.0.14, SDL_ttf v2.0.15, SDL_mixer v2.0.4 and SDL_image v2.0.5.
It is a simple maze where you have to make the blue square reach to the orange finish line.
In the future I will make better buttons, brand-new mechanics, more levels and I will make the main menu button ACTUALLY WORK.

# About

You might be wondering why the name is gravity-maze instead of maze.
The mechanic I was planning about there being 2 gravity axises(up-down, left-right) and you use the arrows to switch axises and change your direction in the current axis.
